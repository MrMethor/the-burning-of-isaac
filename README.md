This is my 1st year university project.
It is a program made in pure java, with very little experience in OOP and programming in general.
Based on the popular video game The Binding Of Isaac, it's my wastest project so far in terms of scope.
All the code is made by me except the classes Manager, Canvas and Image, which could be looked at as the "engine".
The performence varies somewhat for reasons I am not aware.
The resources are taken from various sources listed in the "sources.txt" file.
There is some problem launching the program from my IDE, so the most reliable launch method is to run the isaac.jar file
located in either "The Burning Of Isaac\src" or the compiled "The Burning Of Isaac\out\production\The Burning Of Isaac"

Controls:
W, A, S, D     - Movement
Arrow Keys     - Fire
E              - Enter a door/trapdoor
Esc            - Menu
